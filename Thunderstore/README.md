Check the template file that gets generated for an example of the json layout

Template path `BepInEx\GameData\ScanPositionOverride\Template.json`

`Tpositions` can be empty and is used for assigning travel positions for moving scans

Use the BepInEx log to verify the positions of the scans as well as what index they are

Use UnityExplorer to get the local player's current position for preferred placements

Restarting the game is required for changes to be applied currently

All players must have the mod installed and the possition files, otherwise desync will occur
